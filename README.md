# Overview

You play as a small cube that falls. There are four buttons you can use to change the cube’s color. When you collide with a tile that matches your cube's color, you gain a combo. When you collide with a different color, you bounce off — and your score is calculated as **time falling × combo**.

The goal is to reach the bottom and get the highest score possible.
